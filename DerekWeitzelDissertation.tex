\begin{abstract}
Distributed computing has evolved to include many federated resources across geographical, networking, and administrative boundaries.  The ability to access and use federated storage has lagged behind the ability to access the compute capabilities of the resources.  In order to incorporate storage resources, the storage first needs to be accurately described to meet the needs of the application.  Further, in order to optimize data movement, the data movement should be negotiated between the storage resource and the target.  The negotiated data movement device will allow the storage (or an agent on the behalf of the storage) to determine it’s preferred transfer methods, and to match that method with the target device, allowing each to express preferences and requirements.  In order to provide an additional option for distributed storage and data movement, a transfer method is introduced that is designed to run on federated resources by using peer to peer connections and data transfers.  To conclude, a variety of workflows are discussed and demonstrated using these enhanced tools with decreased time to completion.
