\begin{abstract}
Campus computing has evolved from many small decentralized resources to fewer, larger centralized resources.  But this change has harmed the researcher?s user experience.  When the resources were decentralized, the cluster may have been just down the hall from their research lab.  They had privileges to install software and control the scheduling of their computationally intensive jobs.  Now, as we have moved towards fewer but larger centralized computational resources, the users have fewer privileges than they enjoyed previously.  They can no longer install software or control the scheduling of their jobs.

I propose that users should have their privileges restored onto the computational resources by creating an overlay cluster they are able to control.  Both job submission and data distribution should come from the user?s computer to the campus resources.  Additionally, these methods should transparently scale to national cyberinfrastructure if the user?s demands increase.

First, I explore methods for improving the user experience when submitting jobs on a campus grid.  To this end, I created a remote submission and overlay computational framework called Bosco.  This framework can remotely submit processing from the user?s laptop to clusters on the campus or on national cyberinfrastructure.  In order to improve the user experience of remote submission I created BoscoR, an interface to Bosco in the popular statistics and data processing programming language, R.  Bosco improves the user experience of submitting to campus clusters, while also being an efficient method for job submission.

Second, I discuss the issues with data distribution on the campus.  In order to solve some of the issues with data distribution on opportunistic resources, I created the CacheD, a framework for distributed caching and data transfers for the campus.  The CacheD optimizes transfers to multiple resources by using the group transfer protocol BitTorrent.  Further, the CacheD optimizes shared data between multiple jobs by caching the input data directly on the execution resources.  The CacheD decreases the stage-in time over current transfer methods and significantly decreases stage-in time when the data is already cached.

Third, I explain how to control data distribution on a campus through a comprehensive policy framework.  This framework is implemented in the CacheD.  I thoroughly discuss the policy language, available attributes, and how to extend the policy language beyond the default behavior.  Multiple examples are given for different data distribution scenarios observed on campus resources.   

Combining Bosco, the CacheD, and the storage policy language, we created a unified campus submission and data distribution framework.
