\section{Introduction}

In this chapter I will discuss the methods developed to aid in distributed scientific computing on a research campus.  

\section{Access to Computation on the Campus}

This could be merged with the introduction

Discuss
\begin{itemize}
\item Typical Campus resources
\item How users get access to these resources
\end{itemize}

\section{Bosco}

\begin{itemize}
\item How Bosco addresses the concerns in the above.
\item Why users would want to use Bosco over other solutions
\item Architecture
\end{itemize}

\section{Load Balanced Access to Computational Resources}

\begin{itemize}
\item Advantages of using the Campus Factory
\item Architecture
\item How the campus factory + bosco create utopia!
\item How the submission works using bosco
\end{itemize}





\section{Conclusion}
